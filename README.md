## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.8.1 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Firebase account (for cloud features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sakib-Hasan3/CareSync-Family-Health-App.git
   cd CareSync-Family-Health-App/caresync
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - Add your `google-services.json` (Android) to `android/app/`
   - Add your `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) to `ios/Runner/`

4. **Set up AI Assistant (Optional)**
 4. **Set up AI Assistant (Optional)**

    The app supports using an AI service key (Google Gemini, Deepseek, or other OpenAI-compatible keys).

    - Recommended (development): provide the key at runtime or via secure storage in the app settings.

    - Run with API key:
       ```bash
       flutter run --dart-define=GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
       ```

    - Build release with API key (not recommended for production builds):
       ```bash
       flutter build apk --dart-define=GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
       ```

    - For production, host a small backend proxy that holds the API key and forwards requests from the app. This avoids shipping secrets in client binaries.

    *Note: Without an API key, the app will use offline health guides from `assets/guides/`*

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
